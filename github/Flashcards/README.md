## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I could't quite get the flipping of the flashcards to work. I created two different components for the front and back of each flashcard and tried to display each part based on the selected state of the flashcard using conditional rendering. However, this still failed to work after putting in hours of my effort trying to figure it out.
